## Name / classification

Curiously Recurring Template Pattern

## Also known as

Recursive Type Bound, Recursive Generic

## Intent

Allow derived components to inherit certain functionalities from a base component that are compatible with the derived type.

## Explanation

Real-world example

> For a mixed martial arts promotion that is planning an event, ensuring that the fights are organized between athletes
> of the same weight class is crucial. This prevents mismatches between fighters of significantly different sizes, such
> as a heavyweight facing off against a bantamweight.

In plain words

> Make certain methods within a type to accept arguments specific to its subtypes.

Wikipedia says

> The curiously recurring template pattern (CRTP) is an idiom, originally in C++, in which a class X
> derives from a class template instantiation using X itself as a template argument.

**Programmatic example**

Let's define the generic interface Fighter

```java
public interface Fighter<T> {

  void fight(T t);

}
```

The MMAFighter class is used to instantiate fighters distinguished by their weight class

```java
public class MmaFighter<T extends MmaFighter<T>> implements Fighter<T> {

  private final String name;
  private final String surname;
  private final String nickName;
  private final String speciality;

  public MmaFighter(String name, String surname, String nickName, String speciality) {
    this.name = name;
    this.surname = surname;
    this.nickName = nickName;
    this.speciality = speciality;
  }

  @Override
  public void fight(T opponent) {
    LOGGER.info("{} is going to fight against {}", this, opponent);
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return name + " \"" + nickName + "\" " + surname;
  }
```

The followings are some subtypes of MmaFighter

```java
class MmaBantamweightFighter extends MmaFighter<MmaBantamweightFighter> {

  public MmaBantamweightFighter(String name, String surname, String nickName, String speciality) {
    super(name, surname, nickName, speciality);
  }

}

public class MmaHeavyweightFighter extends MmaFighter<MmaHeavyweightFighter> {

  public MmaHeavyweightFighter(String name, String surname, String nickName, String speciality) {
    super(name, surname, nickName, speciality);
  }

}
```

A fighter is allowed to fight an opponent of the same weight classes, if the opponent is of a different weight class
there is an error

```java
MmaBantamweightFighter fighter1 = new MmaBantamweightFighter("Joe", "Johnson", "The Geek", "Muay Thai");
MmaBantamweightFighter fighter2 = new MmaBantamweightFighter("Ed", "Edwards", "The Problem Solver", "Judo");
fighter1.fight(fighter2); // This is fine

MmaHeavyweightFighter fighter3 = new MmaHeavyweightFighter("Dave", "Davidson", "The Bug Smasher", "Kickboxing");
MmaHeavyweightFighter fighter4 = new MmaHeavyweightFighter("Jack", "Jackson", "The Pragmatic", "Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu");
fighter3.fight(fighter4); // This is fine too

fighter1.fight(fighter3); // This will raise a compilation error
```

## Applicability

Use the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern when

* You have type conflicts when chaining methods in an object hierarchy
* You want to use a parameterized class method that can accept subclasses of the class as arguments, allowing it to be applied to objects that inherit from the class
* You want certain methods to work only with instances of the same type, such as for achieving mutual comparability.
